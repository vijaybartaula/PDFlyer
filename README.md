## Our Story

In the year of grace, amidst the growing shadows of complexity and cost, **PDFlyer** emerged. It was a solution born from necessity. The tools of the past, burdened with intricate demands, asked for gold and ignored the sacred trust of privacy. In this moment, we, the creators, sought to craft a solution simple in form and noble in intent. One that would neither strain the purse nor betray the trust of its users.

Founded by leap year in 2024, a fellowship of developers and designers labored with unwavering hearts. We sought not just to create a tool, but to build a haven where managing PDFs would be effortless. We believe that all, from noble merchant to humble scribe, should control their documents without fear for their privacy or resources.

Today, **PDFlyer** stands as a beacon guiding individuals and businesses across the globe. Workflows, once burdensome, are now swift. The worries of users have been lifted, allowing their spirits to soar.

This side project was completed about half a year ago. Time passed, and the folders sat untouched, like quiet little graveyards of effort and intent. Today I opened them again and decided it was time. Time to push this live.

**Here’s to shipping, even if it’s late.**
